# Intelligent-Personal-Assistant

### Objective Of The Project

This project aims to create such an intelligent personal assistant application whose purpose is to help its users perform basic tasks like scheduling e – mail, spam filtering according to user labels etc. This is initially expected to run on textual commands that is - be able to classify the given text command into classes of objects and actions. This can be accomplished by *Text Classification* – using written command and classify them into objects and actions, and then apply appropriate learning algorithm to train the neural network. Once we are able to train the neural network using examples, it is used to classify the test data set. The two major classes needed for our application are – object and action. Also, action parameters are required to be defined that specify the weight of action and degree of importance and priority of the action.
